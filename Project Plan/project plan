The project plan consists of the topics and the work distributed between each team members.
The topics in the Project Plan: 
-Task Estimation in Scrum
-Code Reviews 
-Coding Standards

The step after this is, to decide who is going to work on what task. As there is a group of 3 each person will have one topic to themselves, but at least 2 group members will contribute to each topic. So realistically, everyone will put in the same amount of work.
