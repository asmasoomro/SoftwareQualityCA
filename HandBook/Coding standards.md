## # What are Coding Standards? 
Coding Standards are a collection of rules that programmers adhere to when utilizing a certain programming language on a given project. These standards include written language definitions for a broad range of topics, including programming processes, styles, and methodologies for every facet of the program.

### Why Coding Standards are Important? 
Coding standards support the production of high-caliber software and code by your team. But what exactly is meant by "high-quality code"?

You and your users may be sure that your software is dependable, safe, and secure when it has high-quality code. You and your team will profit when your code satisfies these three requirements.

#### How to follow Coding Standards:
1. Is there legible code?
2. Will you comprehend what is happening if you go back to the code later?
3. What kind of code base comments are you making?
4. Have you produced more effective code that is more difficult to read but quicker to write?
A team can start drafting their Coding Standards paper after taking into account the aforementioned four elements.

##### Benefits Offered by Coding Standards:

**Decreased Failure Rate:** Coding standards improve source code's efficiency and readability, which helps developers better comprehend code modules. By guaranteeing appropriate architecture and module coupling, this effectively meets customer requests and lowers project failure rates.

**Optimized Development Time:** By lowering errors and guaranteeing code quality, coding standards implementation expedites development time. By completing projects on schedule, this helps software development companies stay competitive and gain the trust of their clients.

**Easier Debugging:** By making code more readable and organized, coding standards make debugging easier. This is particularly beneficial when debugging is carried out by developers who are not the original authors of the code since it saves time and effort.

**Economical Maintenance:** Development time and expenses are decreased by the ease of reuse and maintenance of standardized code. Even in the event that the original developer is not there, it enables simple code functionality references. To further enhance system flexibility, coding standards can be modified to satisfy organizational needs.
