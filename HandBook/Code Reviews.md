## What is a Code Review ? 
Code review is a software quality assurance activity in which source code is viewed and evaluated by one or more individuals. Code reviews take place as a safety measure to prevent errors or upon the completion of a software development feature. At least one reviewer must not be the code's author. Based on static code analysis by peers and automated reviewers, code review is a widely used technique in software development to enhance the quality of software code. Studies show evidence of a decrease in the quantity of defects found after release.
# Code Review Process
Code is sent by the author for review.
An automated reviewer analyses and grades code based on factors like complexity, documentation gaps, and failed unit tests.
After that, the code is given to a group of reviewers who can debate it, ask questions, offer suggestions for each line, and decide which of these two use cases best summarises their comments.

1. The modifications are not feasible to execute
2. The modifications are able to be put into practice.
A piece of code can be approved for merging into the main branch if it complies with standards and has been examined by every team member.
