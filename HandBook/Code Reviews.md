## What is a Code Review ? 
Code review is a software quality assurance activity in which source code is viewed and evaluated by one or more individuals. Code reviews take place as a safety measure to prevent errors or upon the completion of a software development feature. At least one reviewer must not be the code's author. Based on static code analysis by peers and automated reviewers, code review is a widely used technique in software development to enhance the quality of software code. Studies show evidence of a decrease in the quantity of defects found after release.
# Code Review Process
- Code is sent by the author for review.
- An automated reviewer analyses and grades code based on factors like complexity, documentation gaps, and failed unit tests.
- After that, the code is given to a group of reviewers who can debate it, ask questions, offer suggestions for each line, and decide which of these two use cases best summarises their comments.

1. The modifications are not feasible to execute
2. The modifications are able to be put into practice.
- A piece of code can be approved for merging into the main branch if it complies with standards and has been examined by every team member.

# Why we Review Code ? 
The following are just a few of the reasons why organisations and individuals ought to incorporate code reviews into their projects.

1. Consistent planning and execution
2. Reducing the impact of your errors
3. Ensuring that the project complies with the specifications
4. Enhancing the efficiency of the code
5. Exchanging novel methods
Code review provides a new pair of eyes to find bugs and basic coding errors before your product moves on to the next stage, which expedites the delivery of software to the customer. It's great to just go over someone's code and point out mistakes. However, there must also be some accountability and follow-up when it comes to the code peer review procedure. Before going into production, make sure there is a procedure in place for checking in again to make sure any code discrepancies have been resolved.
